This repository contains the aggregated data and code necessary to reproduce the main results of our paper entitled "*Estimating Zika virus attack rates and risk of Zika virus-associated neurological complications in Colombian capital cities with a Bayesian hierarchical model.*"

The models are run using the package RStan. Information about Stan (including how to download the package and its dependencies) can be found here: https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan
